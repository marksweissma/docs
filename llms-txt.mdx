## What is llms.txt?

The `llms.txt` file is an industry standard that helps LLMs index documentation content more efficiently. It contains:

- Site title and description
- A structured list of all pages with their descriptions
- Links to each page in the documentation

The `llms-full.txt` file combines the entire documentation site into a single file, making it easy for AI tools to ingest all content at once.

## Usage

You can access these files by appending `/llms.txt` or `/llms-full.txt` to the documentation URL. AI assistants like Claude, ChatGPT, and Cursor can use these files to better understand and reference the Moxn SDK documentation.
