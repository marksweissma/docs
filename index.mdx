# Moxn SDK

A powerful prompt editor with Git-like versioning and type-safe code generation.

Moxn gives AI engineers a rich editing environment for building, versioning, and observing prompts—with the same productivity tools you expect from modern development workflows.

## The Problem

Prompts are code, but they don't have the tooling.

When building AI applications, you face a familiar set of challenges:

- **No dedicated tooling**: Prompts are scattered across code comments, YAML files, and spreadsheets—with no proper editor for structured content
- **No version control**: Prompts live in code comments, config files, or databases with no history
- **No type safety**: Input variables are stringly-typed, leading to runtime errors
- **No observability**: You can't see what prompts actually ran in production
- **No collaboration**: No shared workflows for reviewing prompts or debugging production traces

Moxn solves these problems by treating prompts as first-class versioned entities with type-safe interfaces and full observability.

## How Moxn Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Author prompts in the rich editor">
    Build prompts with mermaid diagrams, code blocks, XML documents, images, and PDFs. Define typed variables that connect to your backend models.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate type-safe models">
    Run codegen to create Pydantic models for your prompts. Get autocomplete and validation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use in your code">
    Fetch prompts, create sessions with your data, and send to any LLM provider. Or push existing prompts from your codebase to Moxn.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Log telemetry">
    Log LLM calls with full context—input, output, and trace hierarchy. You control what gets logged.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Quick Example

```python
from moxn import MoxnClient
from moxn_types.content import Provider
from anthropic import Anthropic

# Define your session data (generated via codegen)
session_data = YourInputModel(
    query="How do I reset my password?",
    user_id="user_123"
)

# Fetch a prompt and create a session
async with MoxnClient() as client:
    session = await client.create_prompt_session(
        prompt_id="your-prompt-id",
        session_data=session_data
    )

    # Convert to Anthropic format and send
    anthropic = Anthropic()
    response = anthropic.messages.create(
        **session.to_anthropic_invocation()
    )

    # Log the interaction
    async with client.span(session) as span:
        await client.log_telemetry_event_from_response(
            session, response, Provider.ANTHROPIC
        )
```
